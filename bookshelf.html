    <p>I enjoy reading. I also enjoy giving and receiving book recommendations. 
        If you know any great books, <a href="https://twitter.com/NickMatthew414">DM me!</a><br/>I try to record every book I read on my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/37911190?ref=nav_mybooks" target="_blank">goodreads</a>. 
        Consider any book Iâ€™ve rated 4 or higher to be one that I recommend. 
        The books on my favorites list are those that I especially loved or have significantly influenced my thinking.
