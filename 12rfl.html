    </ul>

    <p>Rather than haphazardly following good advice, I've found it useful to develop a system of memorable, wide-ranging rules, and to take those rules very seriously.
        <br>These rules were chosen as valuable principles that I need to be frequently reminded of or that sometimes go against my natural tendencies.

    <ol>
        <li>Escape Competition</li>
        <li>Keep Your Identity Small</li>
        <li>Find Everything Interesting</li>
        <li>Make Things</li>
        <li>Seek Variance</li>
        <li>Synthesize</li>
        <li>Read, Write, and Code, a lot</li>

    <p>Notes: 1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esk7W9Jowtc" target="_blank">Thiel on Girard</a>. Mimetic Theory is fairly popular now, but most think of it as another useful mental model, when in reality, it's a much more profound insight. 2. <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html" target="_blank">Keep Your Identity Small</a>
    3. "Everything is interesting" - Tyler Cowen 4. From <a href="https://patrickcollison.com/advice" target="_blank">here</a>, among other places
    6. Pretty common idea but I've always enjoyed this <a href="https://civilizationemerging.com/higher-dimensional-thinking/" target="_blank">mental model</a> 8. <a href="https://www.navalmanack.com/almanack-of-naval-ravikant/find-a-position-of-leverage" target="_blank">Find a position of leverage</a></p>
